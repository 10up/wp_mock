# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/10up/wp_mock)

## Branches

* WP_Mock adheres to [SemVer](http://semver.org/) (semantic versioning).
* The current "stable" release version lives on the **trunk** branch.
* If there is a current development release, it will live on a **{version}-dev** branch.

## Pull Requests

* New features must be submitted against the **trunk** branch.
* Bug fixes should be submitted against the branch in which the bug exists, which is likely **trunk**.
* If you're not sure whether a feature idea would be something we'd be interested in, please open an issue before you start working on it. We'd be happy to discuss your idea with you.
* Please update the **documentation** as appropriate to reflect any changes or features you have introduced in your pull request.
* Please implement appropriate **unit tests** for any code changes you are submitting in your pull request.

## Merging

* As of 2019, all merges to the **trunk** branch will be squash merges of features.
* If there are multiple features pending in a release, we will create a **{version}-dev** branch to track development against that version. Once the version is ready, that branch will be squash-merged into **trunk** as well.
* When a pull request is merged, the **Squash and Merge** option **must be used** when merging a pull request.
