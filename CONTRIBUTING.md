# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/10up/wp_mock)

## Branches

* We try to follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/) in WP Mock
* The current "stable" release version lives on the **master** branch.
* If there is a current development release, it will live on a **{version}-dev** branch.

## Pull Requests

* New features must be submitted against the the **master** branch
* Bug fixes should be submitted against the branch in which the bug exists, which is likely **master**.
* If you're not sure whether a feature idea would be something we'd be interested in, please open an issue before you start working on it. We'd be happy to discuss your idea with you.

## Merging

* As of 2019, all merges to the **master** branch will be squash merges of features.
* If there are multiple features pending in a release, we will create a **{version}-dev** branch to track development against that version. Once the version is ready, that branch will be squash-merged into **master** as well.

## Thanks
